## Observations

- Yes, the participants had some things in common, such as the topics relating to the species of tigers. As well as putting characteristics and color variations together.

- Both were confused as to how to categorize the topics

- They struggled with topic related to the facts and statistics of tigers. As well as topics about the different kinds of tigers; including different color variations of tigers (my wording for the topic may have been confusing)

- For the most part, it is a bit of both. Some of the topics were grouped together from both participants, yet some other topics are placed completely differently.

- Yes, the results were similar to my expectations for the most part. 

- I felt confused just as they were considering the fact that my topic choses for some were not as clear and straightforward as I wanted them to be.
